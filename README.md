const projectName = 'myProject';

gulp.task('html', function() {
  return gulp.src([`${projectSource}/Views/*.cshtml`, `!${projectSource}/Views/Layout.cshtml`, `!${projectSource}/Views/*.ref.cshtml`])
        .pipe(previewCshtml(`${projectSource}/Views/Layout.cshtml`, projectSource))

        }))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'));
});

## Working with partials 

All you have to do is create a .ref.cshtml file near regular partial .cshtml. So if you import navigation like
```
@Html.Partial("/Views/Partials/_MainNavigation.cshtml")
```
you don't have to 
change your _Layout/_Whatever.cshtml file. Just copy static html to `/Views/Partials/_MainNavigation.ref.cshtml`


## Changelog

#0.2.0 
- added support for @Html.Partial imports.
